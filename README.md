# HomeAssistant - MelView

HomeAssistant component for mitsubishi air conditioner (MelView) for Australia and pehaps New Zealand
It handles climate control as well as zone control


## Alternatives with more functionality

Unfortunately, I've had very little time to focus on this, so it's stagnated with a few things to do.
Currently it lacks `async` support, plus zones and dynanamic fan speeds are only in the `dev` branch.

There is a fork - https://github.com/haggis663/ha-melview - which has this plus releases to HACS, so that's probably the best replacement for anyone who needs more functionality.

I do hope to work on this again in the future, but I have no idea when...

## Installing

- Clone the required parts of the repo to <config_dir>/custom_components/melview/ or use HACS (add custom repository)

Restart home assistant, refresh browser cache and add integration melview
